This app will give you a unique stretching routine daily.

This app is based on "Becoming a Supple Leopard" by Dr. Kelly Starrett. I think this book is a great resource for athletes or really anyone dealing with pain. It's about more than just stretching or being flexible. It is about correcting various mobility issues that lead to soreness and pain and developing proper mobility patterns instead.

In the book, he gives a stretching program template that one can use to develop a consistent stretching routine. It is difficult to follow this program in the book, however, because it only gives the categories of the exercises to do and not actual prescriptions.

The exercises and program are great because of the work Dr. Starrett has put into it. This app aims to make it easy to follow a simple stretching routine based on his information.

Still to do:
- Some pictures are missing. Add in those pictures.
- Make the app responsive on mobile
- Add descriptions for each exercise
- add an "About" page
